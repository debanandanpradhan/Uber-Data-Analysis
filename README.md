# Uber-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes Uber trip data to predict fare and trip duration based on factors like distance, time of day, and day of the week. Using machine learning models (e.g., linear regression), the project forecasts these attributes, with model performance evaluated via metrics like MSE and R-squared for accurate predictions.
